0,0,Keith Garlington,rotten,Trust me when I say this â€“ reading about the movie is a lot more fun than watching it.,0.7841
1,1,Brian Eggert,rotten,"All build-up and no pay-off, Fantastic Four attempts to reboot the popular Marvel superhero team with new actors, a fresh young director, and a studio whose rocky track record with Marvel properties doesn't promote confidence.",0.8028
2,2,Kip Mooney,rotten,Its talented cast is wasted in a big lead-up to a whole bunch of nothing.,0.0258
3,3,Nick Levine,rotten,A horribly botched reboot that squanders a talented young cast.,-0.0258
4,4,Rudie Obias,rotten,"You've got to hand it to Josh Trank for making a movie that fails in almost every way. Fantastic Four is just frustrating because you can see hints of something interesting, but without the knowledge to build upon those ideas.",0.3112
5,5,Mike Massie,rotten,What starts as a prime example of how not to construct an origins feature quickly turns into the perfect formula to avoid when making motion pictures in general.,0.3612
6,6,Brent McKnight,rotten,The film is such an obvious set up for more that it watches like they forgot to write anything but the beginning.,0.1901
7,7,Mikel Zorrilla,rotten,The worst thing of all is the bad taste in the mouth that stays because the movie is nothing more than a mess introduced to desperation to try to give the public what a superhero movie is supposed to give you. [Full Review in Spanish],-0.8513
8,8,Dan Scully,fresh,"It's here that the movie hits its stride, and although it takes a dark turn, it's fun in precisely the way the movies it's aping classically are.",0.5106
9,9,Debbie Lynn Elias,rotten,There is nothing fantastic about Fantastic Four.,-0.7048
10,10,Katie Smith-Wong,rotten,"Similar to the upcoming third reboot of the Spiderman franchise, this Fantastic Four reboot feels unnecessary. The story has not changed, nor has the dynamic of the group.",0.4707
11,11,Brandon Davis,rotten,"Fantastic Four is a radically different approach to the franchise. While this version of the characters may work out in the future, their establishment is anything but stimulating.",0.7311
12,12,Josh Wilding,rotten,"Fantastic Four won't leave you hungry for sequel; it will leave you desperate to forget what you just watched. Signs of greatness are there, but ultimately, this movie is little more than a mess and a crushing disappointment.",-0.8916
13,13,Kate Rodger,rotten,"Fantastic in name alone, this film is far from it.",0.3818
14,14,Mattie Lucas,rotten,Creaks and groans along for a mercifully short hour and 40 minutes while neglecting the basic fundamentals of storytelling in a surprisingly cavalier way.,-0.128
15,15,Cameron Ward,rotten,Fantastic Four sets itself well for a sequel if turned off well before the final act.,0.7783
16,16,Mae Abdulbaki,rotten,It's an extremely rough film where there are a lot of edges that needed to be smoothed over.,0.0
17,17,Rachel Wagner,rotten,The story from start to finish was cliched and silly.,0.0258
18,18,Bernard Boo,rotten,"It takes itself too seriously, it's colorless visually and emotionally, and it dupes us by promising something ""Fantastic"" and instead delivering a lifeless black hole of an experience that'll ruin your day. There's no fun to be had here.",-0.1779
19,19,Paula Fleri-Soler,rotten,It never reaches the glorious heights we have come to anticipate from Marvel's diverse universes.,-0.5448
